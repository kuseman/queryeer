build(deps-dev): Bump com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc
fix: Refactor select into subsystem into catalogs to prepare for catalogs to implement insert into
fix: Add ValueVector#hasNulls to prepare for omptimizations in various places to skip null check's. Added check in min/max aggregate function
fix: Removed ValueVector#literal methods that had a varargs input, only used in test code and there VectorTestUtils already has the needed methods
fix: Bundle info to TableFunctionInfo#execute/getDescribeProperties to ease future development without breaking
feat: Add bytes/second metric to OpenCsvFunction
feat: Return a shema to OpenCsvFunction if columnHeaders option is provided

v1.9.7
fix(test-suite): Add another dimension to harness tests where we now run all queries with typed vectors which means we now have 4 combinations of every query being tested: - schema full + any vectors - schema less + any vectors - schema full + typed vectors - schema less + typed vectors
fix: Fixed issues found when adding above tests
fix: Fix issue in resolving operatorfunctionscan schema that yielded runtime error in certain cases
fix: Fix issue when resolving an expression worked in current scope but failed in outer scope and caused a crash
fix: Remove Optional<Schema> argument to catalog getDatasource methods. It was only confusing and made no sense, now instead the returned vectors are adjusted/validated in TableScan/IndexScan instead to ease the burden of catalog implementations
fix: Remove Optional<Schema> argument to table function execute method. It was only confusing and made no sense, now instead the returned vectors are adjusted/validated in TableFunctionScan instead to ease the burden of catalog implementations
fix(ESCatalog): Add Arity on match/query functions
fix: Cache calculation of hash code for UTF8String
fix: Fix issue where push down predicates wasn't pushed down inside a subquery
fix: Fix issue where index seek keys was re-used in wrong datasource caused by mutability in StatementContext, now instead we store the index keys connected to it's owning table source to avoid mis-usage.
fix(ESCatalog): Fix issue where outer referenced expressions wasn't used when pushing down predicates

v1.9.6
feat: Implement projection push down optimization. Now catalogs get a projection definition that can be used to optimize data fetching if supported.
feat: Re-implement HTTP catalog in table-source mode to utilize mustache templating to better be able to implement more complex http bodies etc.
fix: Remove IDatasourceOptions that was sent into execute call in IDatasource. Only confusing and weird
feat: Add support for executing queries and working with the raw TupleVectors produced
fix: Remove TableSourceReference.Type#CONSTANTSCAN since that was a weird construct.
fix: Now a subQuery table source is tagged on expressions / columns that lacks during resolving to make expression evaluation more robust

build(deps): Bump org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 from 3.13.0 to 3.18.0

v1.9.4
feat: Add query option to force no index on a join that otherwise would be an indexseek. This is needed sometimes where a simple hashmatch is actually faster (usually when there is many rows with no hits then all batching will eat up all the performance) feat(JbcCatalog): Add two table options:  - tableHints: Adds a hints string after the table alias part. Example for SQL server is to add "WITH(NOLOCK)"  - projection: A little shortcut until projection pushdown is implemented in PLB core. Now one can hint a comma separated                string that will be the projection to the downstream select, this to avoid excessive data to be fetched due to asterisk select.
fix: Change to UNION ALL when building index seek query, the input values are unique
fix: Fix issue with no hits on index seeks on temporary tables where the index:ed types was different than the seek value types. Now we store the types that was used during index build and use the same types on the seek values when hashing.
feat(HttpCatalog): Add support for printing response headers

v1.9.3
fix: Fixes an issue in hash match where we returned an empty tuple vector in left Join mode where all outer rows got a hit.
This in turn trigged another issue when an upstream hash match was executing in index mode, then we tried to fetch inner rows by an empty outer tuple vector that threw an exception
(since it's now allowed to use an empty tuple vector as seek index vector).

v1.9.2
fix: Add proper URL encoding of endpoints in HttpCatalog
fix: Guard against NPE when fetching datastreams without any properties
fix: Fix index seek to adapt to batch_size option and call downstream datasource in batches

fix: Evaluate set statements during complie phase to be able to use variables fully in UseStatements etc.
feat: Add string_split scalar function
fix: Include indices in temporary tables meta query
fix: Double the buffer capacity when resizing to avoid to much allocation/copying
fix: Increase performance by precalculating table stats. upon create instead of when used

feat: Introduce a MutableValueVector type to replace all previous builders and was used and is much easier to comprehend and use.
feat: Added a new eval method that takes a selection value vector as input, this to make evaluation must more performant and easier to use. Note that not all expressions has implemented this method here.
fix: Misc allocation fixes when building result vectors
fix: Fixed wrong AtTimeZone expression type
fix: Changed implemenation of CaseExpression to not evaluate expressions for rows that does not need evaluating. This also fixes contract problem where we earlier evaluated else path (or other conditions) for rows that should not get into else.
fix: Fix issue in function openxml when all values in a column was effectively null
fix(ESCatalog): Add retry to HttpClient to recover from slow ELK instances
feat: Implement HashJoin as physical join algorithm
fix: Remove ColumnReference to make all sourounding code a bit easier. That was a really weird construct when we already has CoreColumn to add extra stuff that didn't belong to standard Column.

v1.0.5
feat: Add a unique id to TableSourceReference to be able to have multiple joined data sources with the same actual table
fix: Fix issue with implicit casting from Any (Int/Long) to Boolean
fix: Lower allocations i NestedLoop by only creating loop row and cartesian columns when needed

fix: Performance fixes in ExpressionMath to avoid allocations when comparing known stuff fix: Optimizations in ObjectBufferVectorBuilder to intern objects and transforming all strings to UFT8String fix: Re-implemented group by to a much more memory efficient structure     This made it possible to run the #1brc in PLB :). Completed at 0:05:42 with a couple of 100 Mb heap
feat: Add TVF openjson, opencsv, openxml that streams input and batches tuplevectors
feat: Changed HTTP catalog to redirect responses to these functions instead of implementing their own parsing
fix: Move missing write methods into OutputWriter to be able to override in writers.
fix: Use bytes version of UTF8String for literals to avoid creating strings when doing comparisions etc. This is a performance fix for catalogs that is optimized and uses only bytes strings aswell. This might harm catalogs that don't uses bytes strings but that should be ok.

feat(core): Total rewrite of core module. (#41)

- Vector based execution engine. Now all expressions are executed vector by vector and not row by row
  - New data model between operators. Now there is a flat column based model like a regular DBMS'es has
  - Schema and type system. Now all columns/expressions have a proper type. Catalog
    implementations can provide a fully typed Schema for tables/functions to allow for better compilation
    support and execution performance

feat(core): New operators
  - distinct
    Produces the distinct set of input rows
  - having
    Filters a group by input

feat(core): New functions
  See https://github.com/kuseman/payloadbuilder/wiki/Functions for more information
  - abs
  - isjson
  - isjsonarray
  - isjsonobject
  - reverse
  - string_split
  - toarray

  - ceiling
  - char
  - charindex
  - floor
  - current_timezone
  - format
  - least
  - greatest
  - left
  - right
  - object
  - object_array
  - totable
  - avg

DEPRECATIONS:
  - SQL
    - 'Populate' query hint is deprecated and a regular keyword should be used instead: "INNER POPULATE JOIN <tableSource>"
  - Functions
    - CAST function when having a string expression as data type is deprecated and a string literal should be used instead: "CAST(<expression> AS <data type literal>)"
    - DATEPART/DATEADD function when having a string expression as date part is deprecated and a string literal should be used: "DATEPART(<date part literal>, <date expression>)"

BREAKING CHANGE:
  - Java 17 Baseline
  - Catalog API is totally rewritten in favor of Vector exeution and Schemas. See built in Catalogs for examples
  - Changed behaviours
    - Before when casting an expression to data type DATETIME it was auto transformed into system local time zone and that is not the case anymore because a DATETIME
      has no time zone and casting it into a zoned DATETIME makes no sense and is simply wrong.

      Example:
      Before an expression like this "CAST('2010-10-10T10:10:10Z', 'datetime')" would result in a value like "2020-10-10T12:10:10" (assuming this was executed on a system with +02:00 offset)
      And after this change that expression would simply return the string casted to a DATETIME type who's string representation would be "2010-10-10T10:10:10".
      To get back the old behaviour we need to cast this to a DATETIMEOFFSET and then switch the
      timezone like this: "CAST('2010-10-10T10:10:10Z' AS datetimeoffset) AT TIME ZONE <time zone expression>"
  - Removed functions
    - attimezone
      - replace by "AT TIME ZONE" expression
    - convert
      - was only an alias to CAST
    - union
      - complex function that did more harm than good
    - listof
      - replace by ARRAY function
    - open_map_collection
      - Used when turning a list of JDK maps to a table. Replaced by TOTABLE function in combination with expression table source
        Ie.
        select *
        from (totable(<expression convertable to table>)

        example:
        select *
        from (totable(json_value('[ { "Key": 123 }, { "Key": 456 } ]'))) t
    - open_rows
        Used to turn a populated alias into a selectale table source. Replace by expression table source
        Ie.

        select (
           select *
           from (b) t    <----- select from populated column 'b'
           for object
        ) values
        from tableA a
        inner populate join tableB b
         on ....
